#   Python for Engineers

This module could potentially follow-on to CS 101 with a focus on necessary engineering conventions we are currently unable to cover in that class.

## Desiderata

- Data types, control structures
- Unit testing
- Working with other codes as a driver/glue/wrapper
- Function decoration
- Optimization (Cython, Numba, etc.)
